	The manager wants you to show him the name of the lawyer with the most clients, the one with the fewest and the client average considering all lawyers.
	OBS: Before presenting the average, show a field called Average to make the report more readable. The average must be presented as an integer.
    
    Obs.: O segundo parametro da função round determina o número de casas decimais.
